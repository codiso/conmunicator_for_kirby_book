# Conmunicator

![](../../de/images/installation/cmu_website.jpg)
Conmunicator is a bridge between Adobe Muse CC and an Content-Management-System. You create your design in Adobe Muse CC and afterwards you will export the design to one of the supported Content-Management-Systems.

The Adobe Muse CC project will still be your design project and it is a fix member of your workflow. Change the visual design in Adobe Muse CC and bring it back to the CMS, without loosing the connection between both worlds.

Dynamic content will be delivered by the CMS. Creating individual Templates, by coding them by yourself, is no longer necessary.
