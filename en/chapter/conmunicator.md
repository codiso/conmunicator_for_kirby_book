# Conmunicator

![](../../de/images/installation/cmu_website.jpg)
Conmunicator is a bridge between Adobe Muse CC and an Content-Management-System. You create your design in Adobe Muse CC and afterwards you will export the design to the CMS.

The Adobe Muse CC project will still be your design project and it is a fix member of your workflow. Change the visual design in Adobe Muse CC and bring it back to the CMS, without any problems.

Dynamic content will be delivered by the CMS. Creating individual Templates inside the CMS is no longer necessary.
