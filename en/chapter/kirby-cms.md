# The Kirby-CMS

Kirby is a file-based CMS, which does not require the use of a database. It is not a open source system but very easy to use, fast and it works also with smaller webspaces.

Nevertheless, Kirby has a number of features which can be used with a website . Structures are represented by folders and content is based on flat files that make these available. The Kirby own slogan "Easy to setup. Easy to use. Flexible as hell." describes the CMS probably best.
