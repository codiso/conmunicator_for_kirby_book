# Moodboard

Creating a Adobe Muse CC page named "cmu_moodboard", let you convert styles from Adobe Muse CC into another context.

Normaly the HTML code generated by an CMS is different from the HTML generated by Adobe Muse CC. In this case it would be nice to convert a style defined in Adobe Muse CC into another style for the CMS element.

## Example

There is a style named "**h1**" in Adobe Muse CC and you whant to use this definition for a element coming from Kirby.

|name of the style in Adobe Muse CC|Element selector for Kirby|
|-|-|
|h1|div h1|

To get this achived, you have to write some Text inside a textframe of Adobe Muse CC:

```
{{css :: h1 | div h1}}
```

If the Text in the text frame uses the style to convert, you can write the alternative text. The keyword "**self**" references the used style "**h1**"

```
{{css :: self | div h1}}
```

When exporting the Adobe Muse CC project to your server, the styles are automaticly converted in a own CSS file. This CSS file ist added to the code of the page coming from the CMS.
