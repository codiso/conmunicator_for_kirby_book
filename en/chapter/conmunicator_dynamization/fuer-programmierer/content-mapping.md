# Content Mapping

To use this feature you can create device folders (desktop,tablet,phone) in the folder /conmunicator/devices/. Each device folder can contain a text file, which shall comply with the following notation.

```
content_mapping.php
```

If a device has no specific file, the "desktop" version will be tried to load. If this file does not exist, the "content mapping" does not take place.
