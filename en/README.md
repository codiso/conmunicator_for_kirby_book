# Introduction
The workflow in developing a websites is redefined since the new generation of WYSIWYG editors are on the market. The new tools generate HTML, CSS and JavaScript without any coding by yourself.

I am a programmer and developer and in the beginning i was initially skeptical about the code quality. But the curiosity bothered me and I just had to try out these tools by my self. After the first steps with different tools I came to a conclution. The reputation is worse than the results that can be achieved with the products.

Most programmers condemn automatically generated code and write this rather self to retain maximum control. I always asked myself if implementing web projects, by writing HTML structure and CSS rules, is the all fulfilling task. Let's face it, this is a dull and time-consuming work and i really want to do other things as a developer.

After my trials, Adobe Muse CC gives me the best results. The common user interface of an Adobe product, lets me build my first site in a very short time. The focus remained consistently on the design of the site, without having seen a single line of code. In addition, the static site functioned perfectly in all major browsers. I was impressed.

Now whats next with such a site, if you normally use a content management system to dynamize the contents of the site? What about rights & rolls and database connection? Since Adobe Muse CC has an HTML export, my first thought was to use this to create corresponding templates and use them in my preferred CMS. I made it and it worked wonderfully.

The only bitter aftertaste was that if you made changes to the Adobe Muse CC project, you went through the process over and over again. While it was still faster as making all the changes by hand it satisfied me not really. This was the main reason to develop Conmunicator. With this tool, the Adobe Muse CC project is the design basis. With little to no programming experience, links to the contents of the Contao-CMS can be produced. A full or partly dynamisation can be done in that way.

With the product I want to address designers who come from the area of Adobe Indesign. Adobe Muse CC takes the metaphor of Adobe Indesign, and opens the world of the Internet for this group in particular. Even for hardcore programmers Adobe Muse CC can be of interest, because there is a great potential in this tool. Adobe has a corresponding programming interface, which gives you the possebility to create extensions for Adobe Muse CC. They are traded on the widget market under http://muse.adobe.com .

Enjoy reading the documentation and use the benefits of Conmunicator. I am always open for questions and suggestions and I hope to get interesting and critical thoughts.
